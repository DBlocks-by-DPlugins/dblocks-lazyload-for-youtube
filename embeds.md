# Embeds

We are using youtube service to generate the embeds for the videos. Once you paste the youtube link, we will generate the embed automatically.

## How to use

1. Go to youtube and find the video you want to embed.
2. Click on the share button and copy the embed code.
3. Paste the embed code in the text field and click on the generate button.

## How is gdpr friendly?

We are using youtube service to embed image, but once image is generated user will not load youtube scripts until he clicks on the play button, he we only see image on the website load.
